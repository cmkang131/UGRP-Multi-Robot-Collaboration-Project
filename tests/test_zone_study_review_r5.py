"""Regression tests of Codex's fifth review of PR 194 (``codex-194-r5``).

The review reported one P1 and two P2 findings against ``4c8f908``. Each test
below reproduces the reported counterexample in memory and asserts the fixed
behaviour; the boundary tests next to it pin the neighbouring cases. Offline
only: no simulator, no model call, no network. The pre-fix failures and the
mutation check are recorded in
``experiments/2026-09-26-zone-study-offline-smoke/review-r5/``.

* P1 — a transport that sent a reserved internal retry and then failed with an
  unknown usage was counted as ONE attempt, and ``commit`` refunded the second
  reservation: 3 real sends, 2 in the ledger, 0 violations.
* P2 — a summary-only record (no ``calls``) lost ``tokens_complete=False`` and
  ``usage_unknown_calls``: the known 833 + 40 tokens became a confirmed 873.
* P2 — repeated trials of one condition/scenario/seed shared one TensorBoard run
  name, so the last one written overwrote the other in the viewer.
