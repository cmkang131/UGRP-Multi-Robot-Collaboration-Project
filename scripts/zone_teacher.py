"""Ground-truth TEACHER executor for the zone benchmark (never a student result).

Each robot job is "move box X into zone slot S". The teacher reads simulator
truth (robot base pose, box pose) to drive and to aim the calibrated arm IK,
and physically grasps with the gripper: no weld or attachment. Its outcomes are
reported as teacher-executor conditions, separate from RGB-skill success.
Robots only ever receive issued-command receipts from it, never these poses.
