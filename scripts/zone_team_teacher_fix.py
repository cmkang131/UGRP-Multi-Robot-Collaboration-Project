"""GT TEACHER fixes for PR #169 feasibility blockers B3 and B4 (zone teacher fix, 2026-09-26).

TEACHER-ONLY. The teacher reads simulator truth (poses, contact forces) and
exists for demonstrations, training targets and scenario feasibility. It is
never the study executor, and a teacher delivery is never a robot success.

This module subclasses the PR #169 team teacher (``scripts.zone_team_teacher``,
not edited) and is selected only by ``scripts/run_zone_teacher_fix.py``. It
does not change ``harness.zone_protocol_v2.CONDITIONS``, the ``ModeLoop``
subclasses, the rendezvous rule, the claim checks or anything a robot's model
reads; robots still get only the two receipts.

B3 (claim-holding robot on a carrying team's route; record: r3 waited at the
heavy_crate west station on the beam route, the carry paused 3 times and ended
``carry_blocked``). Root cause: ``carry_blockers`` asked only IDLE robots to
yield, and a robot with a live claim drove back to (and waited at) a station
inside the team's route. Fix (switch ``b3_claim_yield``):
  1. a robot with a live claim that is not yet in a job (``to_station`` /
     ``waiting``) inside the team's lookahead hull is asked to yield like an
     idle robot;
  2. a yielding robot (idle or holding a claim) steps clear of the team's whole
     remaining route, not only of its next 12 SIM s (the PR #169 yield spot lay
     further along the same route, so the robot was herded ahead of the team
     and paused it again); if no such spot exists it falls back to the PR #169
     spot;
  3. while its claimed station lies inside a carrying team's hull over
     ``STAGE_LOOKAHEAD_S``, the robot does not drive to or wait at the station
     (``station_staged``): it holds where it is, or yields at once if it stands
     inside that hull; afterwards it re-plans to the station;
  4. a robot that is yielding or staged is not a station occupant for the
     rendezvous rule and its own arrival time is reset, so the 60 SIM s wait
     counts from its next physical arrival (the rule itself is unchanged).
  Inputs: the carrying team's held item and its planned route (a physical
  team in motion), never a claim, goal or robot id.

B4 (``hold_lower`` set a beam down where it blocked another item's station).
Root cause: a post-contact failure lowered the item wherever the team stood.
Fix (switch ``b4_return_setdown``): a team failure in CARRY that is only about
motion (``carry_blocked``, ``carry_timeout``) with both grips intact first
carries the item back along the part of its route already travelled to the
item's start pose (clear of stations and lanes by the scenario placement), then
lowers there (``hold_lower`` as before). Grip loss, a failed return or a
second failure lowers in place as before (recorded).
