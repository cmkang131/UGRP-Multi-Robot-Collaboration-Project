"""Messages and claims for mixed zone goals (goal v2, zone team A2, 2026-09-25).

Every robot-facing text of the v2 zone protocol lives here: the static task
text (identical in every coordination mode), the three condition blocks, the
request builders, the reply validators, the robot-visible context and the
scripted fixture replies. Colour-only goals keep ``harness.zone_coordination``
and ``harness.zone_solo`` byte for byte. A later dialogue redesign (Korean
natural language) is meant to change this module only.

Claim form in all three modes: ``{"item": label, "zone": "A|B|C", "role": role}``
(``harness.zone_team_jobs.RoleClaim``). The host never picks teammates: a team
forms only by the physical rendezvous rule, the same in every mode.

Per-condition features are explicit switches (``CONDITIONS``) so that a later
design can turn the host board, host arbitration, event wake-ups or peer
messages on or off independently (R1 audit C1/C3).

executor moves you when you have a claim; you coordinate WHICH item goes to
WHICH zone and WHO holds WHICH handle. Ground choices in the images: {images}.
item_labels are fixed names from the first TOP images (per kind, west to east

rgb_view is the current TOP-RGB estimate, not ground truth. Never claim
simulator coordinates or physical success.'''

PLAN FIRST: agree on the COMPLETE assignment before anyone moves. Only
agreement.proposer may propose while agreement.proposal is null; the others
then reply accept=false, plan=null with a useful peer message. Once
agreement.proposal exists, every robot (the proposer too) either ACCEPTS by
replying accept=true with plan set to an exact copy of agreement.proposal.plan,
or REJECTS with accept=false, plan=null and a reason. accept=true with
plan=null is invalid. Copy proposal_id and plan_hash from agreement.proposal.
A plan lists, for every robot, its ordered jobs {{"item": label, "zone":
"A|B|C", "role": role}} so that every zone receives exactly its goal count per
kind, each item goes to one zone, and every role of a team item is taken by
exactly one robot. Team members arrive at a team item at about the same time
only if it has the same position in their lists; orders that make robots wait
for each other are rejected. Robots run their lists in parallel.

still in pickup (rgb_view.pickup_items_still_visible), a zone that still needs
that kind (goal minus rgb_view.zone_counts_seen minus items already claimed in
team_board.active), and a role (handle) of that item that no peer holds. A free
role of an item a peer already claimed for the same zone joins that peer's
team. If conflict is present, you and a peer claimed the same handle or
different zones for one item: agree (read peer_messages) and choose again.
Everyone answers at once, so if you all yield nobody takes it: unless a peer's
message already gives it to a specific robot, the conflicting robot with the
lowest robot_id keeps it and the others choose a different job or null.
